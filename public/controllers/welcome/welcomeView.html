        Hi guys,<br>
        This is a cool <b>AngularJS & Node.js</b> based application - a simple contacts application.<br>
        You can search, add, edit contacts (based on mock data, there isn't DB avaiable).<br>
        Check out my Linkdin and github.<br>
        Have fun and stay awesome:)
